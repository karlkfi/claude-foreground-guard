Agents foreground-poll instead of backgrounding. In one repo's two-week
transcript sample, **~130 Bash calls were blocking polls** — `gh pr checks
--watch`, `gh run watch`, `tail -f`, `sleep`-loops — each one parking the
session's main thread until something killed it. In the same sample, **36
slow runs** (envtest suites, e2e runs, `-race` builds) were killed by the
Bash tool's **default 2-minute timeout**, wasting the entire run each time.
Repos carry prose rules in CLAUDE.md to prevent this ("never watch in the
foreground", "always set timeout on make test-race") — and agents still do
it. A hook enforces the rule mechanically and teaches the fix in the denial
message at the exact moment of violation.

foreground-guard is a `PreToolUse` hook for `Bash` that catches two classes
of main-thread time-wasters:

- **Class A — foreground poll/watch** (`ask` by default; config may escalate
  to `deny`): watch/follow modes (`gh run watch`, `kubectl logs -f`,
  `tail -f`, `watch ...`), shell loops that poll with `sleep`, chained
  repeat-with-sleep sequences, and bare `sleep N` waits at or above a
  configurable floor.
- **Class B — slow command with an inadequate timeout** (`ask`): a command
  the repo has registered as needing more than the Bash call's timeout —
  about to be killed mid-run. The registry ships **empty**; slow-command
  knowledge is per-repo config.

Everything else passes through silently, so your normal permissions apply.

## What it does

The hook produces one of three outcomes per Bash call:

- **ask** — Claude Code shows its standard permission prompt, with a reason
  that teaches the three fixes: take ONE non-blocking snapshot (`gh pr
  checks <n>` without `--watch`, `tail -n 100` instead of `tail -f`), re-run
  the same call with `run_in_background: true`, or bound the wait explicitly
  with `timeout N ...`. Class B asks name the exact minimum: "set
  `timeout: 600000` on this Bash call, or run it in the background."
- **deny** — only when the repo config escalates Class A to `deny` (or in
  `bypassPermissions` mode, where there is no one to answer an ask — the
  deny feeds the fix back so the agent self-corrects instead of stalling).
  Downgradable to `ask` with a `FOREGROUND_GUARD_OVERRIDE=<reason>` prefix.
- **defer** — the hook stays silent; your normal permission settings apply.
  foreground-guard never emits `allow` (see
  [Soundness](#soundness-never-allow)).

## Install

Install on any Claude Code surface that runs plugin `PreToolUse` hooks — the
CLI, the IDE extensions, or **Claude Code for Claude Desktop**.

**Claude Code (CLI or IDE extension)** — run the slash commands:

```
/plugin marketplace add karlkfi/claude-foreground-guard
/plugin install foreground-guard@foreground-guard
```

**Claude Code for Claude Desktop** — use the **Customize** tab:

1. Open the **Customize** tab and go to its plugins / marketplaces section.
2. Add `karlkfi/claude-foreground-guard` as a marketplace.
3. Find **foreground-guard** in that marketplace, install it, and enable it.

After installing with either method:

- Requires `python3` on your PATH.
- Restart Claude Code (or `/reload-plugins`) so the hook is registered.
- **Turn on auto-update now.** A GitHub marketplace pins the version you
  installed and never refreshes on its own (see
  [Keeping it updated](#keeping-it-updated)). Add this to
  `~/.claude/settings.json` at install time, while you're thinking about it:
  ```json
  {
    "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
      "foreground-guard": {
        "source": { "source": "git", "url": "https://github.com/karlkfi/claude-foreground-guard.git" },
        "autoUpdate": true
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Register your repo's slow commands** — the Class B registry ships empty;
  it only helps once your repo's `.claude/foreground-guard.json` names the
  commands that outlive the default timeout. See
  [Configuration](#configuration).

To verify, ask Claude to run `gh run watch 123` — it should prompt with a
foreground-guard reason. `tail -n 50 some.log` should run without any
foreground-guard output.

## Keeping it updated

Claude Code auto-updates **official Anthropic marketplaces only**.
foreground-guard installs from a third-party GitHub marketplace, and those
**never refresh on their own** — the version you installed stays pinned
until you either enable auto-update or update it by hand.

**Recommended — set and forget.** Add `autoUpdate` for the marketplace in
`~/.claude/settings.json` and Claude Code refreshes it like an official one:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "foreground-guard": {
      "source": { "source": "git", "url": "https://github.com/karlkfi/claude-foreground-guard.git" },
      "autoUpdate": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Manual.** Update the marketplace clone, then the installed plugin, then
restart to apply:

```
claude plugin marketplace update foreground-guard
claude plugin update foreground-guard@foreground-guard
```

## Covered forms

**Class A — watch/follow registry** (built-in; extensible via config):

| Form | Snapshot alternative taught |
| --- | --- |
| `gh pr checks ... --watch` | `gh pr checks <pr>` once, without `--watch` |
| `gh run watch <id>` | `gh run view <run-id>` once |
| `kubectl`/`oc` `logs -f` / `--follow` | `kubectl logs --tail=100` |
| `kubectl`/`oc` `get -w` / `--watch` / `--watch-only` | `kubectl get` once |
| `tail -f` / `-F` / `--follow` (incl. combined `-fn50`) | `tail -n 100` |
| `journalctl -f` / `--follow` | `journalctl -n 100` |
| `docker`/`podman`/`nerdctl` `logs -f` / `--follow` | `--tail 100` |
| `watch <cmd>` | run the wrapped command once |

**Class A — loop and sleep forms:**

- `while`/`until`/`for` loops whose body runs `sleep` (any duration — the
  loop multiplies it).
- Chained repeat-with-sleep: `cmd; sleep N; cmd; ...` — a sleep sandwiched
  between commands is a poll regardless of `N`.
- Bare `sleep N` as a foreground segment with `N ≥` the floor (default
  10 s). `sleep $VAR` counts as long (unknown durations lean toward a
  prompt). Below-floor sleeps — startup grace like `sleep 2 && curl ...` —
  pass.

Matching is anchored to the tool name, so `grep -f patterns.txt`,
`git log --follow`, and `-f` flags on unrelated tools never match. The hook
recurses into quoted `bash -c '...'` and `eval ...` bodies (bounded), but
`bash some-script.sh` stays opaque — no script-file inspection. A repo that
hits a false-positive on a specific built-in watch form can quiet just that
one with a `poll.exempt_watch_patterns` allowlist entry (exemptions win over
matches) instead of turning off all of Class A — see
[Configuration](#configuration).

**Class B — slow-command registry** (config-only, ships empty): regex
patterns mapped to a minimum timeout in ms. When a matched command would run
in the foreground with the Bash call's `timeout` below the minimum (or unset
— the 2-minute default), the guard asks and names the exact fix.

## Exemptions

These pass untouched, by design:

- **`run_in_background: true`** on the Bash call — backgrounding is exactly
  what the guard wants; both classes pass.
- **A trailing `&`** that detaches the blocking command (including a
  backgrounded subshell or loop). A mid-command `& ` exempts just that
  segment: `sleep 30 & make build` passes.
- **A `timeout N ...` wrap** exempts the wrapped command from Class A —
  allow-through, not a downgraded ask. Rationale: an explicit bound is
  precisely the fix the guard teaches, and the Bash tool's own timeout still
  backstops it. `timeout 30 gh run watch 123` runs without friction.
- **Heredoc bodies** are stripped before analysis — `tail -f` inside a
  document you're writing is data, not a command.

## Configuration

Per-repo file: `.claude/foreground-guard.json` (also read from
`~/.claude/foreground-guard.json` for user-level defaults, and from a file
named by `$FOREGROUND_GUARD_CONFIG`). Scalars are last-present-wins (project
overrides user); pattern lists and the slow-command registry merge
additively.

```json
{
  "poll": {
    "enabled": true,
    "action": "ask",
    "extra_watch_patterns": ["^mytool\\s+follow\\b"],
    "exempt_watch_patterns": ["^gh\\s+run\\s+watch\\b"],
    "sleep_floor_seconds": 10
  },
  "slow": {
    "enabled": true,
    "commands": {
      "make test-race\\b": 600000,
      "make test-e2e\\b": 1800000,
      "go test ./\\.\\.\\..*-race": 600000
    }
  },
  "hint": "pr-sentinel watches PRs in this repo — don't poll gh yourself"
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `poll.enabled` | `true` | Class A on/off (switch off as the harness subsumes it) |
| `poll.action` | `"ask"` | `"deny"` escalates Class A to a hard block (override-able) |
| `poll.extra_watch_patterns` | `[]` | extra regexes matched against each wrapper-stripped command segment |
| `poll.exempt_watch_patterns` | `[]` | allowlist regexes over the same segment string; a match suppresses the watch/follow detection (exemptions win over matches) — quiet a false-positive built-in without disabling all of Class A |
| `poll.sleep_floor_seconds` | `10` | bare `sleep N` prompts at or above this |
| `slow.enabled` | `true` | Class B on/off |
| `slow.commands` | `{}` | regex (searched in the raw command) → minimum timeout ms |
| `hint` | `""` | repo-specific line appended to Class A prompts, naming your own watcher machinery |

Environment variables: `FOREGROUND_GUARD_DISABLE=1` turns the hook off for a
session; `FOREGROUND_GUARD_CONFIG=<path>` adds a config file;
`FOREGROUND_GUARD_DEBUG=1` re-raises instead of failing open (development).

## Friction report

Run `/foreground-guard:friction-report` to see where the guard's prompts land.
It re-reads the decisions Claude Code already recorded in your local session
transcripts (no telemetry — see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)) and ranks them, so you
can tell in one command whether the friction is mostly foreground watching,
`sleep`-polling, or slow commands hitting an inadequate timeout.

```
/foreground-guard:friction-report                      # last 7 days
/foreground-guard:friction-report --since 24h --repo gateway
/foreground-guard:friction-report --json               # machine-readable
```

The `foreground-guard:` prefix is worth keeping: the companion guards
([prod-guard](#companion-plugins), workspace-guard) each ship their own
`friction-report`, so the bare `/friction-report` is ambiguous when more than
one is installed.

Prompts are grouped into a stable category taxonomy, each mapping to one fix:

| Category | Class | Fix it teaches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `watch` | A | one non-blocking snapshot, or `run_in_background: true` |
| `loop-sleep` | A | one status check now; background the wait or check next turn |
| `sandwich` | A | one status check now; background the wait or check next turn |
| `bare-sleep` | A | skip or background the wait; do the follow-up check now |
| `slow-timeout` | B | set an adequate `timeout:` on the call, or background it |

The script runs standalone too:
`python3 scripts/friction-report.py --plugin all` reports every sibling guard's
decisions found in the transcripts.

## The override escape hatch

When config escalates Class A to `deny`, a genuinely-intentional foreground
wait can be downgraded to a confirmation prompt by prefixing the command:

```
FOREGROUND_GUARD_OVERRIDE=demo-needs-live-tail tail -f app.log
```

Mirroring prod-guard's semantics: the override downgrades **deny → ask** —
it never silently allows. The reason string is echoed back in the downgrade
prompt for the human reviewing it (an audit trail, mirroring
workspace-guard); make it say why the foreground wait is required.

## Soundness: never `allow`

The hook only ever returns `ask`, `deny`, or nothing (defer). It **never**
emits `permissionDecision: "allow"` — an allow would bypass your permission
settings and override sibling guards evaluating the same command. This
invariant is asserted on every end-to-end call in the test suite. All
failure directions follow from the guard's job:

- **Infrastructure errors fail open** (bad JSON, unreadable config,
  unexpected exception → silent defer): a productivity guard must never
  break the session.
- **Unknown durations fail toward friction** (`sleep $N` prompts): a false
  positive costs one prompt; a false negative parks the main thread.
- **Parsing uncertainty defers**: unlike a security guard, a missed poll
  costs waiting, not an outage — so unparseable commands pass rather than
  guess.

## Limitations

- `bash some-script.sh` is opaque: a poll loop inside a script file is not
  seen (same policy as the sibling guards — no file inspection).
- Watch modes reached through uncovered wrappers or aliases
  (`k logs -f ...`) need an `extra_watch_patterns` entry.
- Class B matches the raw command text; a slow command constructed at
  runtime (`make $TARGET`) won't match.
- The guard cannot start a background task for you — it can only teach the
  fix and let the agent retry with `run_in_background: true`.

## Companion plugins

- [workspace-guard](https://github.com/karlkfi/claude-workspace-guard) —
  keep Bash file operations inside the workspace.
- [branch-guard](https://github.com/karlkfi/claude-branch-guard) — keep
  commits off protected branches.
- [prod-guard](https://github.com/karlkfi/claude-prod-guard) — block
  mutating infrastructure commands aimed at production.

All four compose: none of them ever emits `allow`, so each can only add
friction, never remove another's.

## Privacy

Everything runs locally; the hook reads the command from stdin and local
config files, and writes a decision to stdout. No telemetry, no network.
